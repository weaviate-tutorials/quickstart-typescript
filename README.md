# Weaviate quickstart code - TypeScript

This repo contains TypeScript code to follow along with the Weaviate
[Quickstart](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/quickstart). The code
corresponds to the Quickstart as of 2024-07-31.

There are two code files.

- `quickstart-setup.ts` This code creates a collection.
- `quickstart-query.ts` This code queries the collection.

Both files use the [TypeScript v3 client](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/typescript/typescript-v3).

Use `quickstart-setup.ts` to create the example collection.
To run a query, edit `quickstart-query.ts` and uncomment the line that calls the
query.
